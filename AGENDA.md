# Networking and Proxy Lab Agenda

A structured approach to understanding networking concepts through hands-on proxy exercises.

## üîå Core Proxy Types & Concepts

### Forward Proxy (HTTP/S)
- Inspect request/response data
- Experiment with common proxy tools
- Analyze protocol differences (HTTP 1.1 vs 2)

### Reverse Proxy
- Set up a reverse proxy server
- Add TLS termination and path-based routing
- Explore forwarding headers

### SOCKS5 Proxy
- Configure dynamic port forwarding
- Inspect traffic through analytical tools
- Explore DNS behavior and isolation

## üß™ Advanced Tunneling and Proxy Use Cases

### SSH Tunneling
- Expose local services remotely
- Chain multiple connection hops
- Implement resilient connections

### HTTP CONNECT Tunnels
- Study tunneling mechanisms
- Understand visibility considerations

### Proxy Chaining
- Route traffic through multiple proxies
- Observe encryption boundaries

### Transparent Proxy
- Implement transparent traffic interception
- Applications for testing and filtering

## üîç Protocol-Level Investigation

### Packet Inspection & Analysis
- Inspect protocol layers through proxies
- Filter by various protocol attributes

### TLS Handling Methods
- Compare security approaches
- Implement capture techniques

### Application Protocol Tunneling
- Explore alternative tunneling methods
- Test implementation tools

## üß∞ Practical Tools & Scenarios

### Proxy Configuration
